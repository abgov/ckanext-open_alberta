A child was included in the counts if they received services through Initial Assessment, Child Intervention or Post-Intervention Supports during a fiscal year.

Some employers may have more than one WCB account. Employers may be reassigned to a new industry based on changes in their operations or based on changes in WCB’s industry descriptions. Care should be taken in considering which operation is being referenced in these dataset. In addition, industries deemed as “voluntary” under WCB legislation are excluded. 

Although some employers have addresses outside of Alberta, this report only includes claims accepted by Alberta Workers’ Compensation Board.

Claims may be registered by an employer, an injured worker or a health care provider within two years of the incident occurring. WCB regularly audits employers to ensure they comply with reporting claims properly. 

The fatality incidents, lost-time claims (LTC), and disabling injury claims (DI) are based on incidents that were accepted by WCB for compensation as of March 31, 2014. LTC rates, DI rates and Certificate of Recognition (COR) information are calculated using methodology that is applied consistently across all employer records.

Municipalities also submit statistical information returns each year as required under the MGA, which include data on several characteristics of the municipality (such as area, number of dwelling units, tax rates, kilometres of roads, water and wastewater mains, etc.).
